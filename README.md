# Introduction 
A small portfolio about, here you can find some /*details about me!*/

# Technologies used
I used sass embadded with bootstrap to style my website with some help of node.js models and some npm backages.
If you want to run the project in your local mechain you will need to download node.js and bootstrap and link them to the source code.<br />
**How to download node.js:** you will need to go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and follow the steps. You will also need to download npm to your machin but don't worry, it will be install with the backage of node.js so then you can use the npm commands anytime :) <br />
**How to install bootstrap:** since now you have npm install you can use this command to install bootstrap ```npm install bootstrap@3```
